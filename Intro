->I'm Ranjith working in public cloud team from GFO, Just to give overview of project
->we are migrating services from PCF to AKS and highlevel architecture
->we will get request from the users through the Akamai(external network layer)
->From Akamai requests go to Azure front door, from F/D it goes to static web apps
SWA to centralized APIM(API Management) 
This APIM decides which service to call based on url and send to specific backend service
->We have around 160 services that need to be migrated. We are migrating services on phased manner, first we pick up 5 services and those are in UAT
 now, by this weekend we are planned to move to silent prod.
//while migrating other services, domain teams will comes into picture.

Updating services to be compatible with azure
1)Every application is integrated with Redis cache
2)And We created a new gateway called cloud gateway b/w services and apim
3)Azure SQL connectivity 
4)and every service is getting data from procedures from the oracle side but to improve the performance we are asked to convert those sotred procedures
 into optimized snowflake sql queries and integrate in to service
5)Created a Go-init container to fetch secrets from the key vault
6) Created docker file and build image for every service
